## <a id='buildpack'></a>About the PHP Buildpack ##

For information about using and extending the PHP buildpack in Cloud Foundry,
see [the php-buildpack Github repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack).

The current information for the buildpack can be found at its [Github release page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases).
The buildpack currently uses a default php version of `5.5.27`. To change the default version, specify the `PHP_VERSION` key in your app's `.bp-config/options.json` file.
