title: PHP Buildpack
---

Use the PHP Buildpack with PHP applications including Wordpress, Cake, Symfony and Zend frameworks.

The PHP buildpack supports HHVM and PHP engines.

See the following topics:

* [Deploying and Developing PHP Applications](./gsg-php-usage.html)
* [PHP Buildpack Configuration](./gsg-php-config.html)
* [Composer](./gsg-php-composer.html)

The source for the buildpack is [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack).

## Buildpack Logging and Application Logging ##

The buildpack only runs during the staging process, and only logs
what is important to staging, such as what is being downloaded, what the
configuration is, and work that the buildpack does on your application.

The buildpack stops logging when the staging process finishes.
Application logging is a separate concern.

If you are deploying a PHP application, your application must write to STDOUT or STDERR to include its logs in the Loggregator stream.

See [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](../../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).
