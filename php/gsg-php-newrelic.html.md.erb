[New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) collects analytics about application and client-side performance.

## <a id="configuration"></a> Configuration

There are two different ways to configure New Relic for the PHP buildpack.

### With a CF service

Bind a NewRelic service to the app, the build pack will automatically see this and it'll setup NewRelic.

   It should generally work as long as the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable contains a service called `newrelic`, that service dict has a key called `credentials` and that in turn has a key called `licenseKey`.

   *WARNING:* It won't currently work with user provided services.

### With a Licence key

If you already have a New Relic account, this is the preferred method.

1. Go to New Relic to find your [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key).
1. Set the environment variable `NEWRELIC_LICENSE`; either through the [manifest.yml file](/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#env-block) or with `cf set-env`.  The value of this should contain your NewRelic license key.
