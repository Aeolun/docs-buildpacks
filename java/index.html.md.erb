title: Java Buildpack

Use the Java buildpack with applications written in Grails, Play, Spring or any
other JVM-based language or framework.

See the following topics:

* [Tips for Java Developers](./java-tips.html)
* [Configure Service Connections for Grails](./grails-service-bindings.html)
* [Configure Service Connections for Play](./play-service-bindings.html)
* [Configure Service Connections for Spring](./spring-service-bindings.html)
* [Cloud Foundry Eclipse Plugin](./sts.html)
* [Cloud Foundry Java Client Library](./java-client.html)
* [Build Tool Integration](./build-tool-int.html)

The source for the buildpack is [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack).

## <a id=''></a> Application Logging with the Java Buildpack ##

Your application must write to STDOUT or STDERR for its logs to be included in the
Loggregator stream.
See [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](../../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).

The Java buildpack source documentation states:

* The Java buildpack logs all messages, regardless of severity to `<app dir>/.java-buildpack.log`.  It also logs messages to `$stderr`, filtered by a configured severity.

* If the buildpack fails with an exception, the exception message is logged with a log level of `ERROR` whereas the exception stack trace is logged with a log level of `DEBUG` to prevent users from seeing stack traces by default.
