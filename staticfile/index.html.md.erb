## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

### <id='introduction'></a>Introduction

This topic describes how to configure the Staticfile buildpack and use it to push static content to the web. 

<hr>

### <a id='staticfile-app'></a>Definition: Staticfile app

A **_staticfile app_** is an app or content that require no backend code except an Nginx webserver.

Examples of staticfile apps are front-end JavaScript apps, static HTML content, and HTML/JavaScript forms.

<hr>

### <a id='staticfile-buildpack'></a>Definition: Staticfile buildpack

The **_Staticfile buildpack_** is the buildpack that provides runtime support for staticfile apps and apps with backends hosted elsewhere.

For example, works for apps and content that require no backend code besides an Nginx webserver, which the buildpack provides.

<hr>

### <a id='memory'></a>About memory usage


Nginx only requires 20&nbsp;M to serve static assets. 
Using the `-m 64 M` reduces the RAM allocation from the default 1&nbsp;G usually allocated to Cloud Foundry containers.

### <a id='sample'></a>Create and push a sample app

The procedure below describes how to create and push a single page staticfile app using the Staticfile buildpack.

1. Create a root directory for the sample app in your workspace:
    
    <code>
    $ mkdir sample
    </code>
2. Create an `index.html` file that contains some text:

    <code>
    $ echo 'Hello World' > index.html
    </code>

3. Create an empty file named `Staticfile`:

    <code>
    $ touch Staticfile
    </code>

4. Push the sample app:

    <code>
    $ cf push hello -m 64M
    </code>
  
5. Find the URL of the hello app in the output and navigate there to see the static app running.

    Highlight the code output ADD

## <a id='configure-and-push'></a>Configuring the buildpack and pushing the app

### <a id='config-options'></a>Configuration options

This list explains some of the aspects of the Staticfile buildpack that you can configure:

* **_Directory list_** — An HTML page that displays a directory index for your site. A sample of a directory list is shown below. 

    ![Directory Index](../images/directory-index.png)

    If your site is missing an index.html, you can choose to display a directory list instead of the standard 404 error page.

* **_SSI_** — Server Side Includes (SSI) is ...

* **_Pushstate routing_** — A way to keep browser-visible URLs clean for client-side JavaScript apps that serve multiple routes. 

    For example, pushstate routing allows a single JavaScript file route to multiple anchor-tagged URLs that look like `/some/path1` instead of `/some#path1`.

* **_GZip file serving and compressing_** — 
The [`gzip_static`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html) and [`gunzip`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gunzip_module.html) modules are set to `on` by default.

* **_Proxy support_** — Allows you to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging.

* **_Force HTTPS_** — A way to enforce that all requests are sent via HTTPS. This redirects non-HTTPS requests as HTTPS requests. For information about when not to force HTTPS, see [About FORCE_HTTPS with reverse proxies](#force-https) below.

### <a id='basic-auth'></a>Creating hashes for basic authentication

You can apply basic authentication to your app. 

![Basic Authentication](../images/basicauth.png)

Use this website to create hashed username and password pairs for your website:

### <a id='force-https'></a>About FORCE_HTTPS with reverse proxies 

If you are using a reverse proxy such as CloudFlare and you have rules to redirect HTTP, do not use FORCE_HTTPS. 
This is because the reverse proxy is intended to communicate directly with the app through HTTP.
Forcing the reverse proxy to communicate with the app can cause redirect loops.

The diagram below illustrates a HTTPS redirect loop and direct HTTP communication between a reverse proxy and an app server.

### <a id='config-process'></a>Configure and push your app

3. In the root directory of your app, create an empty file named `Staticfile`:

    <code>
    $ touch Staticfile
    </code>

2. Configure the Staticfile buildpack for the needs of your app.

    <table border='1' class='nice'>
    <tr>
    <th><strong>If you want &hellip;</strong></th> <th><strong>Then&hellip;</strong></th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>to serve <code>index.html</code> and other assets not from the root directory</tc>
    <td>add this line to the static file:<br><code>root: DIRECTORY_NAME</code><br>for example, <pre class='terminal'>root: public</pre></td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
    <td>display a directory list instead of the standard 404 error</td>
    <td>add this line to the Staticfile:<br><code>directory: visible</code></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>disable gzip_static and gunzip modules so that...</td>
    <td>add this line to the Staticfile:<br><code>directory: visible</code></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>enable pushstate routing</td>
    <td>add this line to the Staticfile:<br><code>pushstate: enabled</code></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>enable SSI</td>
    <td>add this line to the Staticfile:<br><code>ssi: enabled </code></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>enable basic authentication for your app or website</td>
    <td>create a file called Staticfile.auth in the root directory or alternative root directory and add one or more user/password lines to it. 
    For example,<br> <code>bob:$apr1$DuUQEQp8$ZccZCHQElNSjrg.erwSFC0<br>alice:$apr1$4IRQGcD/$.UMFLnIHSD9ZHJ86TR4zx.</code><br>
    For more information, see [Basic Authentication](#basic-auth) above.</td> 
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Force HTTPS</td>
    <td>add the line<br><code>FORCE_HTTPS: true</code> to a file called <code>nginx.conf</code> in your root directory or alternate root directory.</td> 
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>make additional configuration changes to Nginx</td>
    <td>add `nginx.conf` and `mime.types` to your root folder or to the alternate root folder if you specified one.</td> 
    </tr>
    </table>

1. Push your app:

    <code>
    $ cf push APP_NAME -m 64M
    </code>

    where `APP_NAME` is the name you want to give your application. 

    For example, 
    <pre class='terminal'> 
    CODE OUTPUT GOES HERE
    </pre>

2. Find the URL of your app in the output from the push command above and navigate there to see your static app running.
