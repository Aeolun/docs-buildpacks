title: Ruby Buildpack

Use the Ruby buildpack with Ruby, Rack, Rails or Sinatra applications.

See the following topics:

* [Tips for Ruby Developers](./ruby-tips.html)
* [Configure Service Connections for Ruby](./ruby-service-bindings.html)

The source for the buildpack is [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-buildpack-ruby).

## <a id=''></a> Application Logging with the Ruby Buildpack ##

Your application must write to STDOUT or STDERR for its logs to be included in the
Loggregator stream.
See [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](../../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).

The Ruby buildpack does **not** automatically configure your app to stream logs
to STDOUT or STDERR.
