title: Node.js Buildpack
---

Use the Node.js buildpack with Node or JavaScript applications.

See the following topics:

* [Deploying Node.js applications](./node-tips.html)
* [Configure Service Connections for Node](node-service-bindings.html)

The source for the buildpack is [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/heroku-buildpack-nodejs).

## <a id=''></a> Application Logging with the Node.js Buildpack ##

Your application must write to STDOUT or STDERR for its logs to be included in the
Loggregator stream.
See [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](../../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).

The Node.js buildpack does **not** automatically configure your app to stream logs
to STDOUT or STDERR.
