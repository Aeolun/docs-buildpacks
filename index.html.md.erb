title: Buildpacks
---

Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications.
Buildpacks typically examine user-provided artifacts to determine what dependencies to
download and how to configure applications to communicate with bound services.

When you push an application, Cloud Foundry automatically installs the required
buildpack on the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) where the application needs to run.
This is called [buildpack detection](./detection.html).

Cloud Foundry has three **system buildpacks**:

* [Java](./java/) for applications written in Java, Grails, Play, Spring or any other JVM-based language or framework
* [Node.js](./node/) for applications written in Node or JavaScript
* [Ruby](./ruby/) for applications written in Ruby, Rack, Rails or Sinatra

If your application uses a language or framework that Cloud Foundry
buildpacks do not support, there are several options you can try:

* [Customize](./custom.html) an existing buildpack or write your own
* Use a [Cloud Foundry Community Buildpack][c]
* Use a [Heroku Third-Party Buildpack][h] (these may work with Cloud Foundry but have not been verified to do so)

[h]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/third-party-buildpacks

Heroku developed the buildpack approach and made it available to the open source community.
