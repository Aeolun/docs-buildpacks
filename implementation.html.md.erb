# Buildpacks for the Enterprise

If you understand the need for offline buildpacks, you can skip this introduction and head over to the
[Offline Modes documentation](./offline_modes.md).

## Introduction to Buildpack Dependencies

Buildpacks often need access to runtime binaries for the platform they are targeting.

For example, depending on the source it's building from and at the time of writing, [Heroku's Ruby buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby) requires:

  * A Ruby interpreter (out of 5 MRI, 26 JRubies, and some experimental Rubinius')
  * Libyaml (out of 2 versions)
  * Bundler
  * Node

The Ruby buildpack uses public accessible Amazon s3 hosting for these dependencies.

## Online Cloud Foundry Deployments

Online deployments of Cloud Foundry, such as [Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io/), generally work well with third party and Heroku buildpacks without modification.
You can specify the use of these buildpacks with the `-b` option to the Cloud
Foundry CLI.

When building droplets, [the DEA](../concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html)
executes the buildpack within a container whose network can reach the Internet
entirely unimpeded.

Many Pivotal customers do not allow the DEA, or any part of their Cloud Foundry
deployment, unimpeded access to the Internet.
Security and Change Management concerns impact how an enterprise, and even small
businesses, decide to architect their network.

To satisfy these customers, Pivotal forks existing buildpacks, or creates customized ones which support the loading of dependencies from behind a firewall. When building your buildpack, you should consider these mechanisms, especially if you want your platform adopted by enterprise companies.

For a breakdown of offline modes and how to implement them, go to the [Offline Modes documentation](./offline_modes.md).

The Cloud Foundry specific buildpacks can be found on [the Cloud Foundry wiki](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks).
