## <a id='pushing_apps'></a> Pushing Apps ##

This buildpack will be automatically used if there is a `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` file in the root directory of your project.

If your Cloud Foundry deployment does not have the Python Buildpack installed, or the installed version is out of date, you can use the latest version with the command:
```bash
cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-python.git
```

### <a id='runtime'></a>Specify a Python Runtime ###

Specific versions of the Python runtime can be specified with a `runtime.txt` file:

    $ cat runtime.txt
    python-3.5.1

The buildpack only supports the stable Python versions, which are listed in [manifest.yml](manifest.yml) and [releases page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases).

If you try to use a binary that is not currently supported, staging your app will fail and you will see the following error message:

```
       Could not get translated url, exited with: DEPENDENCY_MISSING_IN_MANIFEST: ...
 !
 !     exit
 !
Staging failed: Buildpack compilation step failed
```

### <a id='vendoring'></a>Vendoring app dependencies ###

As stated in the [Disconnected Environments documentation](https://github.com/cf-buildpacks/buildpack-packager/blob/master/doc/disconnected_environments.md), your application must 'vendor' it's dependencies.

For the Python buildpack, use ```pip```:

```shell
cd <your app dir>
mkdir -p vendor

# vendors all the pip *.tar.gz into vendor/
pip install --download vendor -r requirements.txt
```

```cf push``` uploads your vendored dependencies. The buildpack will install them directly from the `vendor/`.

## <a id='proxy_support'></a> Proxy Support ##

If you need to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging, you can set
the `http_proxy` and/or `https_proxy` environment variables. For more information, see
the [Proxy Usage Docs](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/proxy-usage.html).

## <a id='help_support'></a>Help and Support ##

Join the #buildpacks channel in our [Slack community] (http://slack.cloudfoundry.org/) if you need any further assistance.
